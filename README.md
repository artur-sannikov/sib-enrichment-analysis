the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The [course description](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20250314_ENRIC).

## How to run with Nix?

1. Install Nix, for example,
with [Determinate Systems installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer).

2. Enter the project directory, and run `nix-shell`. This will drop you
into the shell with all the packages and RStudio pre-installed.

3. Run `rstudio` to launch RStudio.

If you have [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv), then `.envrc` file
allows us to enter the Nix shell when you `cd` into the directory.
