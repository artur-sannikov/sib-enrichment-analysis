## How to run with Nix?

1. Install Nix, for example, 
with [Determinate Systems installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer).

2. Enter the project directory and run `nix-shell`. This will drop you
into the shell with all the packages and RStudio pre-installed.

3. Run `rstudio` to launch RStudio.

## How to run with Docker/Podman?

If you don't want to install Nix on your main system, it's possible
to run a container with Nix and project packages.
